**redux-presist** - Redux persist takes your Redux state object and save it to Persistence storage.

For example, If we store your redux reducers using redux persist, It will not clear when you close your app. You have that old data when you open your app again.

Whenever you uninstall your app, at that time only your reducers will be clear.

**react-dropzone** -> used for document upload in frontend

**yup** => for validations 

****formik** **=> for form handling

**@mui/icons** => for material ui

for frontend

npm install react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit redux-presist react-dropzone dotenv formik 
yup react-router-dom@latest @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material

weâ€™ve learned how to use Redux Persist in Redux Toolkit to save our data in persistent storage. Therefore, our data will still remain even after a browser refresh. We also explored several options for customizing Redux Persist, for example, specifying which storage engine to use, and customizing what is persisted in our state using the blacklist and whitelist properties.

Although at the time of writing, Redux Persist is under maintenance and has not been updated for some time, it is still a great tool with strong community support.
